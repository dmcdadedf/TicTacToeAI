# TicTacToeAI

This program is an implementation of a MiniMax algorithm to find the next best move in a game of n by n Tic-Tac-Toe.
The n by n is controled by the constant variable size at the top.
The user is then prompted upon runing the program to enter either x or o to go first. If a valid input is not entered, they are asked again.
A list of all the moves made is then put into the consol as they are happening.
Once the game is completed, the program will say if X won, O won, or if it was a tie. It will then print the board to the terminal.
Data is then listed below, giving the runtime of the code in miliseconds, and the number of nodes explored.
